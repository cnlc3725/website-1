            <h3>3D Printing</h3>
            <div>
                I have been 3D printing since 2020.
                I use a software called tinkercad that is web-based to design my 3D prints, and have upgraded my 3D printer 3 times since then.
            </div>
            <div>
                This printer was a great starting one, but in 2022 i decided to upgarde my printer, and got $500 worth of gift card money, enough to buy the ender 3 S1 Pro when it was on sale for prime day. it supports 165mm/s of print speed, and uses either cura or creality slicer, ultimaker cura with a skin over it. It also has a full on 15HZ touch panel for controls and active monitoring with the printer, and also has many mechanisms to protect itself.
                For example, it has a filament detector that will pause the print when it runs too low on filament. It also saves its current progress in the print to the included SD card, and is very customizable, which is why i worked over the course of the year to get the perfect settings and routine for the best possible prints.
                It also comes with an auto probing sensor, which will probe the bed after manual leveling, and will make a 3D map of the print bed so that the printing can be more accurately placed so that the print turns out better. There is also a hot bed os that the print sticks to the print bed better.

                    <p>I have been 3D printing since 2020.I use a software called tinkercad that is web-based to design my 3D prints, and have upgraded my 3D printer 3 times since then. I have done a lot of research for the optimal settings for my printer, and got to where 95% of the time i do my routine, the print is perfect.</p>

                    <h4>December 2020-June 2022</h4>
                    <p>I started with a Labists X1 Mini, with a maximum print size of 100x100x100mm. I used the labists software for it, and the case on the printer head broke. The printer was also very slow, only supported PLA filament, and could not hold any filament roll of the normal size, so you would have to buy the smaller rolls for them to fit. This was a good printer for $100, and was easy to use as a beginner, but was lacking a lot of things that most 3D printers would beefit from. We could have bought osme upgrades for this, but we decided it was time for a new printer.</p>

                        In June of 2023, my cousins got me the Filadryer Mate S1 Plus which heats up a chamber up to 50Â°C, and dries out the filament aftre being there from 3-6 hours. This prevents bubbles or weak points in the filament by getting rid of any moisture before and after printing, and the filament is kept in a box filled with silica gel to keep moisture out.
