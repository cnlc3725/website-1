                I have been coding with blocks since i was six, and have used text coding since I was 9. I have been using text code for 3 years now, so all of this is things i actually know will help. Enjoy!

                    <h4>Blocks</h4>
                    <p>Blocks is the simplest coding language, where you drag blocks together and access drop-down menus to change parts of the block. It is color-coded, which can be an eyesore to some, but is perfect for 5-8 year olds(or younger). If they have not used blocks before, I recommend Scratch JR. For people who have used blocks before, i recommend scratch. I personally started with scratch, and even made my own projects for fun that have been uploaded. Both scratch versions and all of my projects work on any platform.</p>

                    <h4>Python</h4>
                    <p>Python is a more complicated language compared to blocks, but is a great introduction to text coding. It is relatively easy to use, and is one of the languages with the most restrictions in it. It is built for basic website building, automation, and programming robots. I used it to program our VEX V5RC robot and it was simple to learn, even after not using it for too long. I recommend using it with the python extension in Microsoft visual studio Code to make basic programs to automate certain tasks on your computer that are repetitive, or you can have it do random actions and see what it can make in an app.</p>

                    <h4>HTML</h4>
                    <p>Html is suited for designing websites with buttons, multiple pages, images, links, and more! It is more complicated than python, and can't make a ocmplete website on it's own, but can make a working website, ocmpared to python where you make a website that is 1 oage with no buttons, like a newspaper. I recommend programming this in Visual studo as well, and recommend that you get the live server and HTML Preview extensions, so that you can run the page on your web browser and it will update for every change you make, instead of having to re-load it constantly.</p>

                    <h4>CSS</h4>
                    <p>CSS is a way to give your website some style. It will allow you to change colors, add borders, change font, move text and more. It cannot be used without HTML, as it can only style a HTML website, is incompatible with Python(which uses only 1 file type ALWAYS) and is incapable of creating a webite on it's own.</p>

                    <h4>Javascript</h4>
                    <p>Javascript is a good way to add animations or actions to a website.if you want a button to do something other thna take you across the website, you need Javascript. It is mainly used in harmony wiht HTML and CSS to make the website trio, the best set of coding lamguages to make the best website. All 3 have to be used for the website to be any good, but they make some of the most known websites exist today. I recommend using it with HTML and CSS in Visual studio;</p>

                    <h4>C++</h4>
                    <p>This is the most complicated and powerful coding languages. It is very optimised, and is used to make games, applications, and sometimes even operating systems. Visual studio(yes i know, again) is the best for applications and operating systems, while for any type of game you should use unity, and will allow you to make games like minecraft bedrock edition for example, which even though it wasnt made in unity, it was made in C++.</p>

                    <h4>Summary</h4>
                    <p>Visual studio is one of the best applications to use for any ocding language. Unity is used for C++, and use scratch platforms for blocks. Remember to use the website trio to make websites, even if python is easier. i hope this has helped you, and thta you will be able to make your own programsm or websites, like me when i made this website by hand.</p>
