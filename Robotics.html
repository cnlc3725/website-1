            <h2>MY History</h2>
            <p>This pae will talk about what I have done in robotics, and will talk about my passion for it.</p>
            <div>
                I have been in robotics for four years now, between the VEX IQRC, VEX V5RC, and B.E.S.T. Robotics. I have been the lead programmer for most of the year for all years.
                The first year we were in 29th place for VEX IQRC. I only used block coding and adjusted the RPM of the motors and added custom controls so the motors would turn correctly. We did not even make it to the state ocmpetition.
                The second year of robotics I was the lead programer, and sstill used blocks but we got 16th place in state, and then got an invitation to worlds. We had good drive code and autonomous codes that year, a big improvement over last year.
                The third year I was in VEX V5RC. I taught myself the python language, and we had better autonomous than the 1st year, but we weren't really a team. The robot wasn't super good, and the code was limited by the robot. We switched coders in the middle of the year becuase my team didn't like me. We still made it to worlds though.
                The fourth year i was in B.E.S.T. robotics. I will be working wiht 3 other prgrammers to program a robot made out of cardboard, 3D printed materials, and laser cut wood. I am hoping that my team is a good one, and I get to keep my job through the 1st semester, which is how long the program lasts. After that, i hoope to become a robotics aid for VEX robotics (V5RC) at my school.

                    <p>Robotics is a big comittment in your personal life and can take a lot of time, but it will be fun and as logn as you come as much as possible you have a high chance of making it to the higher competitions.</p>
